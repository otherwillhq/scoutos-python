    "## Upload CSV to Scout Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to index a CSV file into a Scout collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example use case presented here involves adding a CSV file that contains a list of queries along with their expected responses. This functionality can be applied to various applications such as Relevance and Generation (RAG) Apps, model fine-tuning, semantic clustering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the CSV will be stored as a separate document. The `text` field will be indexed for semantic search purposes. The `id` serves as the unique identifier for each document; if a document with the same `id` already exists, the new entry will overwrite the existing document. The `title` field of the document determines the title displayed in the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Format\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating documents, the following fields are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: A unique identifier for the document. It should be formatted as a string.\n",
    "- `text`: The main content of the document to be indexed. It should be formatted as a string.\n",
    "- `title`: The title of the document as it will appear in the dashboard. It should be formatted as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a Pydantic model representing the document structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "class Document(BaseModel):\n",
    "    id: str\n",
    "    text: str\n",
    "    title: str\n",
    "    # Any additional keys and their values will be saved as metadata.\n",
    "    # The metadata can be of any valid datatype that is supported by JSON.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that any additional keys and their corresponding values included in the document will be saved as metadata. The metadata can consist of any valid datatype that JSON supports.\n"
